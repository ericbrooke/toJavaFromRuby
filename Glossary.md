* **JVM** - Java Virtual Machine
* **JDK** - Java Development Kit
* **JRE** - Java Runtime Environment
* **Interface** - A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. 
* **Package** - A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
* **Casting** - Convert a variable or object to another "type". For objects only works if the other type is part of the inheritance tree.
* **Autoboxing & Unboxing**
* **Method Overloading** - Within the same class, you can create two methods of the same name but differs in the number of arguments and their types. This is called method overloading. Note that changing the return type alone is not allowed to overload a method. You should change the parameters signature if needed.
* **Method overriding** - occurs when a class inherits a method from a super class but provides its own implementation of that method. 
* **Class variables** - Member variables that have the static modifier in their declaration are called static
fields or class variables. They are associated with the class, rather than with any object. Every instance of the class shares a class variable, which is saved in a fixed memory location. Any object can change the value of a class variable, but class variables can also be manipulated without creating an instance of the class.
